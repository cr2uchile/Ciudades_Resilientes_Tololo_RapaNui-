* This translation process re-formats these data to comply with WOUDC standards.

* This file was generated by GTE_CSX - version 1.0.
* 'na' is used where Instrument Model or Number are not available.

* GTE (Global Tropospheric Experiment) is a project of NASA Langley Research
* Center (NASA-LaRC).  Ozonesonde launches are one component of the data
* collected in support of this mission.

* Latitude of Sonde Launch Station:  -27.17 South
* Longitude of Sonde Launch Station: -109.42 West
* Altitude of Sonde Launch Station: 69.2 Meters
* The integrated column ozone and ozone mixing ratio
* were calculated by NASA as data was not provided
* by Easter Island.  All sonde levels are reported.
