* These data were originally received by the WOUDC in NASA-GTE file format
* and have been translated into extCSV file format for WOUDC archiving.
* This translation process re-formats these data to comply with WOUDC standards.

* This file was generated by GTE_CSX - version 1.0.
* 'na' is used where Instrument Model or Number are not available.

* GTE (Global Tropospheric Experiment) is a project of NASA Langley Research
* Center (NASA-LaRC).  Ozonesonde launches are one component of the data
* collected in support of this mission.

* GTE Station: Easter Island, Chile

* cjo3se01.pmt
* Carreno, Jorge, Met Office, Easter Island, Chile
* Ozone/Ecc sonde
* Pem-Tropics
* Latitude of Sonde Launch Station:  -27.17 South
* Longitude of Sonde Launch Station: -109.42 West
* Altitude of Sonde Launch Station: 69.2 Meters
* The geometric altitude, integrated column ozone,
* and ozone mixing ratio were calculated by NASA
* as data was not provided by Easter.  All sonde
* levels are reported. Time (other than launch
* hour) and relative humidity are missing.
